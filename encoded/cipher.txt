Hello John, today I'm 30. 
I contact you because in 3 days we will have a Zoom meeting to plan the dinner.
Mat thinks you should help us with it. Do you agree ?

The program is to plan the ceremony.
We have a total,amount,budget of 4 733â‚¬ to plan the lunch !

We have to decide where and when the lunch is.
Henry had some great ideas!

Best regards,
Bart
